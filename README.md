# Computer_Vision
- Document the computer vision projects that I have attempted so far
## ["Cut and paste" augmentation]()
- Easy to use Python implementation of "Cut and paste" augmentation for object detection
- The main idea was taken from [Simple Copy-Paste is a Strong Data Augmentation Method for Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.07177v1.pdf)
- - This repo added the capability of saving images and annotations in XML annotation (Pascal VOC format)
## [Annotations Handling Exercise](https://github.com/chongjunn-tech/Computer_Vision/tree/main/Annotations_Handling_Exercise)
- Reading XML Annotations and visualising it on image(s)
- Creating XML Annotations utilising PASCAL VOC Writer
- Resizing an image and its bounding box
## [Data Preprocessing for CV Datasets](https://github.com/chongjunn-tech/Computer_Vision/tree/main/Data_Preprocessing_For_CV_Datasets/ImageNet)
- Document my journey in preprocessing publicly available dataset (ImageNet data) so that it fulfill the desired format in training our model (bags +persons)
